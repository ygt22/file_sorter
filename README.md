### File Sorter Application

This is a simple Python script that sorts files in a given input directory by their creation date and copies them to a specified output directory with a new filename format.

#### Pseudocode for Cli Application

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install Python (if you haven't already).

3. Open pseudocode.py file and apply it inside "file_sorter.py"

4. Run the script using the following command:

```
python file_sorter.py
```

5. The script will prompt you to enter the paths of the input and output directories. Make sure to provide valid paths.

6. The script will then sort the files in the input directory by their creation date and copy them to the output directory with a new filename format: "__\<index\>__\<original_filename\>".

7. The original files in the input directory will remain unchanged.
#### Test
Test files "\<randomname\>+creation_order_number.txt" was created by 50ms intervals.
